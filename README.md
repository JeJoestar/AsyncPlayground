# Asynchronous Programming Examination Playground

Welcome to the **Asynchronous Programming Examination Playground**!

This is a simple console application written in C# designed to demonstrate and explore the use of `async` and `await`. It serves as a hands-on playground for learning and testing asynchronous programming concepts.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to **complete a series of tasks** aimed at optimizing and improving the usage of asynchronous programming (`async`/`await`) in C#.

You are encouraged to:
- Analyze and refactor the existing code
- Optimize asynchronous behavior
- Ensure best practices are followed
- Improve performance and responsiveness where applicable

## Guidelines

- You are **free to modify the code** in any way you see fit, as long as the required tasks are completed.
- Be creative and thoughtful in your approach.
- Make sure to test your changes thoroughly.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio or Rider).
3. Review the existing codebase and instructions for the tasks.
4. Start experimenting with `async` and `await`!

## Submitting Your Solution

Once youâ€™ve completed the tasks:

1. **Push your solution to a public GitHub repository.**
2. Create a **Pull Request** with your changes so we can review and comment on them.
3. Share your repository and PR with **Yevhen Kakaraza** for review.

This process ensures your code is easily accessible, and feedback can be provided directly via GitHub's review tools.

Happy coding, and good luck with your async journey!
